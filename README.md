# draw
- Run `dobmp <filename>` so that you can see the picture appears in your cmd or terminal. Ex: `dobmp self.bmp`  
- Also you can run `dobmp <filename> <filename>`.  
- Before the picture there are some information shown on just ignore it that is what I used for debugging.  
- Every time before start drawing the picture you need to type, any string will be fine(not too long).  
- The window of cmd sometimes be too small to display the whole character, I recommend that press on Ctrl then scroll the wheel let the character smaller to match the size of picture, then drag the window to view the whole
- If you also want to watch the picture you make  
    - Convert your picture to a bmp file.(Only support black-white very sorry)  
    - Put it in the directory.  
    - Run `dobmp <your bmpfilename>`
